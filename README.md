# DISCLAIMER
Be aware that this project was just a way for us to learn how to use Firebase etc. But we are planning to create a larger project near the end of this week which will be more capable and have better functionality such as Private DMs, as well as group messages, texting with pictures. Anyone is welcome to join in on that if you want to.   

# Running the development server

  4. Run the server by `npm start` this will start the app in your browser automatically, if it doesn't open up then, please type in `localhost:3000` in your browser.
